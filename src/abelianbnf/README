This is abelianbnf, version 1.0 of September 2020.

abelianbnf is a gp script computing class groups of abelian fields using the
methods described in the paper "Norm relations and computational problems in
number fields" by Jean-Fran√ßois Biasse, Claus Fieker, Tommy Hofmann and
Aurel Page, available at https://hal.inria.fr/hal-02497890

===============================================================================

To get started, you should first get a copy of Pari/gp at

  http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/download.html
  http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/anongit.html

The Pari/gp version should be the development version or stable >= 2.13.

Then, simply include the file abelianbnf.gp with

  \r abelianbnf.gp

The main functions are:

  abelianbnfinit:
    Input: a polynomial defining a number field
    Output: some technical data

  getcyc:
    Input: the technical data output by abelianbnfinit
    Output: the structure of the class group of the number field

  abelianbnfcertify:
    Input: the technical data output by abelianbnfinit
    Output: 1 if the function successfully unconditionally certified the
      correctness of the computed class group

  vprintab:
    This is a global variable, set to 0 by default. Set it to 1 to get verbose
    output.

Run test.gp to check that the script runs correctly.

See examples.gp and unconditional-cyclotomics.gp for some examples of use.
