CycloDB is a database of invariants of cyclotomic fields. 
Class group structure computations take advantage of norm relations as presented in [1] and were computed using the abelianbnf [2] <a href="https://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/">gp</a> script by Aurel Page.
</p>
<p>
The source code for producing the data is available in the <a href="https://github.com/wjyoumans/cyclodb">site repository</a> and the data is available in raw json format <a href="https://www.cyclodb.org/data.json">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
Currently all class group computations are conditional on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_Riemann_hypothesis">GRH</a>. Once the upper limit of conditional class group computation is reached, unconditional certification will begin and unconditional results will be marked as such.
